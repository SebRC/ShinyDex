# ShinyDex
ShinyDex is an application used for keeping track of data related to finding shiny Pokemon. It is written in Swift.

## Features

### Pokemon data tracking
It can be used to keep track of how many encounters you've had before a shiny appeared.
You can set which game you're looking for a shiny Pokemon in as well as which method you're using and the application will automatically calculate the odds for finding a shiny based on the given combination.

### PP counter
When catching legendaries it can be a good idea to keep track of which moves they've used and how many times they've used them. The PP counter can be used for this.

### Location lookup
If you want to know where you can find a specific Pokemon then you can press the map button. This will take you to the serebii.net page for the Pokemon. From here you can find out how to obtain the Pokemon.
